# From Theory to Sovereign Infrastructure
Translates the DID manifesto into an operational sovereign polity.

- Identity Layer — `did:the.network` root, independent PKI, citizen DIDs + VCs, governance anchored in DID documents.  
- Service Layer — Assembly, Council, Arbitration as DAO smart contracts across distributed nodes.  
- Economic Layer — NWC economy via PoC; Treasury allocations (40/25/20/15); bridges to ETH/Cosmos/BTC.  
- Application Layer — Apps under *.the.network and *.eivissa.network with identity and governance integration.  
- Recognition Layer — JSON-LD registry mirrored to Wikidata and partner accords.  
- Legal Layer — Code as Law; human oversight via Arbitration; sanctions are digital.  
- Continuity Layer — Charter/Genesis pinned to IPFS/Arweave/Git; reconstitution from snapshots.  
- Deployment Layer — Genesis steps; “Deploy first, claim nothing.”  
- Philosophical Core — “Sovereignty by Integrity.”
