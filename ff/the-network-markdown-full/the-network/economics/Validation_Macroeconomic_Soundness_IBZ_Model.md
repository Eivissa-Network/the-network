# Validation — Macroeconomic Soundness of the IBZ Model
**Verdict:** Macro-coherent if reserves and governance are auditable in real time.

## Dimensions
- Reserve diversification: multi-beta hedge akin to central-bank reserves.  
- Yield base: diversified, non-correlated streams; require transparent accounting.  
- Local–global duality: viable with liquidity reserves & DAO rate policy.  
- Governance: participation-weighted to cap plutocracy.  
- Litigation assets: ethical but illiquid; ≤10%.  
- Layer 1 chain: ensures policy independence.

## Alignment with NWC
IBZ ↔ NWC integration: enclave coin, sub-assembly under the Assembly, cross-collateralized yields, bridge-based settlement, UTC as Ambassador.

## Strengthening Steps
Adopt PoC metrics; synthetic anchor; on-chain reserve dashboard; cross-DAO treasury protocol; Recognition Registry; NWC↔IBZ pair; shared PoI index.
