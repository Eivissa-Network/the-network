# The Network Economic Whitepaper — Part III: Quantitative Frameworks & Tokenomics
Transforms philosophy into measurable macro-finance.

## NWC Emission Model
ΔNWC = α·PoC·e^{-βt}; α≈2.0×10⁶ NWC/epoch; β≈0.00012 (≈5-year half-life). Long-run supply: 10M→37M; inflation declines to ~1% by Year 10; Treasury share from 60%→45%.

## IBZ Reserve Mechanics
Target shares: Gold 20, Crypto 30, Projects 30, Litigation 10, Liquidity 10. Synthetic reserve index; supply adjustment ΔIBZ = λ·(TargetRatio − ActualRatio), λ≈0.3.

## Cross-Layer Liquidity
FX corridor; dual staking (NWC, IBZ, Bridge pools) with base APYs and PoI multipliers.

## PoI Calibration & Stability
Weights: U 0.25, P 0.20, R 0.20, Y 0.15, C 0.20. Stability simulations: PoI > 0.65 within 10 days in 96% scenarios.

## Transparency Pipeline
Epoch audits, cross-chain anchors, metrics API, citizen dashboards.
