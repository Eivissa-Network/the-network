# The Network — Builder & Deployer Agreement Framework
Purpose: Bind contributors by integrity, transparency, and the Charter.

## 1. Foundational Context
Contributors (Builders/Deployers) construct and activate systems; accountability to the Charter; open principles.

## 2. Role Definitions
- Builder — designs/codes modules; commits anchored to DID + Charter hash.  
- Deployer — operates nodes and governance infra; publishes health proofs.  
- Auditor — verifies integrity and uptime proofs; reports with VCs.

## 3. Constitutional Acceptance
Charter supremacy; open-source license; Arbitration Court for disputes; contributions become part of digital territory.

## 4. Ethical Oath — Integrity Clause
No proprietary control, backdoors, hidden deps; verification replaces trust; DID-linked identity.

## 5. Legal-Technical Binding (VC)
JSON-LD BuilderCredential with rights/obligations, signed by root; proof of membership/authority.

## 6. Governance & Revocation
DAO vote + Arbitration confirmation; auto-revoke privileges via root namespace; appeals in 21 days.

## 7. Reward & Treasury Participation
PoC rewards based on activity; payment unit NWC.

## 8. Ratification & Hashing
Digital signatures; anchored to Charter Hash; IPFS/Arweave publication.

## 9. Dispute Resolution
Arbitration smart contracts; optional human oversight; enforcement limited to digital sanctions.

## 10. Signature Block
DID, Public Key, Council verification, Date, Hash.
