# The Network Economic Architecture — Sovereignty by Integrity
Dual-layer architecture: **NWC (Sovereign Layer)** and **IBZ (Territorial Layer)**.

## 1. NWC — Sovereign Layer
- PoC mints NWC for transport, storage, computation, quality.  
- Treasury allocations: 40% Infrastructure, 25% Research, 20% Grants, 15% Reserve.  
- Universal settlement, anchor for trust; “NWC is the metric of contribution and proof of integrity.”

## 2. IBZ — Territorial Layer
- Asset-backed reserve basket (gold, crypto, income projects, litigation, liquidity).  
- Regional DAO; local commerce, bartering, and yield.  
- Ibiza as proof-of-economy region within The Network.

## 3. Union
- Value flow: Contribution→NWC→IBZ reserve anchoring→regional surplus→NWC Treasury.  
- Audit feedback loop; algorithmic peg bands; recognition registry.

## 4. Proof of Integrity Index (PoI)
- Composite metric (uptime, participation, reserve transparency, yield sustainability, recognition) → on-chain each epoch.

## 5–7. Interoperability & Expansion
- Cross-DAO Treasury bridge, NWC↔IBZ liquidity gateway, federated expansion, institutional recognition path.
