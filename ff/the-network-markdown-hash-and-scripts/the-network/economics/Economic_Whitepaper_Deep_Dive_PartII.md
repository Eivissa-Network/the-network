# The Network Economic Whitepaper — Deep Dive (Part II)
Operational Mechanisms & Monetary Flows

## 1. Systemic Overview
Two-tier monetary ecosystem: NWC (PoC) and IBZ (asset-backed).

## 2. Monetary Flow Architecture
Contribution → PoC mints NWC → Treasury allocations → IBZ reserve/yield → project revenue → back to Treasury → PoI-weighted rewards.

## 3. Treasury Mechanics
NWC Treasury (DAO multisig; 40/25/20/15). IBZ Treasury (regional DAO policy). Cross-treasury synchronization via bridge; epoch Merkle-proof logs.

## 4. PoI Model
PoI = 0.25U + 0.20P + 0.20R + 0.15Y + 0.20C; used for emissions weight, corridor tuning, and eligibility.

## 5. Liquidity & Exchange Protocols
Algorithmic Liquidity Bands around reserve-weighted peg; rebalancing epochs; arbitrage incentives with fractional PoC yield.

## 6–9. Recognition, Expansion, Continuity, Philosophy
Registry mirrored to Wikidata; phased onboarding; snapshots/exports; “Integrity becomes the new reserve.”
